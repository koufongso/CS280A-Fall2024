                    <p> This project focuses on image morphing, where the shape and color of one image are transformed
                        into another. The project is divided into four main parts:</p>

                            dragging keypoints in real time.</li>
                    </ul>



                    <h2 id="method">Morphing Methodology and Implementation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Weighted Average of Pixels at the Same Coordinates</h4>
                    <p>Morphing combines image warping (changing the shape) and cross-dissolving (changing the color).
                        The simplest method for cross-dissolving is the weighted average method: I(t) = (1-a(t))xI1 +
                        a(t)xI2, where I(t) is the output
                        image at time t and I1 and I2 are the source and target images, respectively. The weight
                        a(t) ranges from 0 to 1, such that when a(t) = 0, the output is the source image, and
                        when a(t) = 1 , it is the target image.</p>

                    <p>The limitation of this method is that it only computes pixel values without considering the
                        underlying semantics of the image, such as the structure or meaning of objects. Therefore, to
                        improve results, we first need to find corresponding pixels in both images that share similar
                        semantics.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Weighted Average of Pixels with Similar Sematics (Correspondence)</h4>
                    <p> Given a pair of pixels/points (called correspondence) (p1,p2) that share similar sematics, but
                        likely have different coordinates, the weighted average point is computed as p(t) =
                        (1-a(t))xp1+a(t)xp2. Using this approach, we can compute a set of "weighted-average"
                        correspondences from two sets of corresponding points.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Triangular Mesh and Warping</h4>
                    <p>We can compute the trajectory of all correspondence points (keypoints), but we still need to
                        handle the other pixels/points. One way to do this is by creating a triangular mesh using the
                        keypoints to cover the entire image.</p>
                    <p>
                        The triangle mesh will depends on the keypoints coordinate the triangulatino algorithm used.
                        Theorecitally there's no restriction on keypoints coordiantes, we can use kepyoints on I1, I2 or
                        any I(t) with a(t) within the rnage of[0,1]. But in practise, we decided to use the "mid-image"
                        to genearete the triangular mesh (i.e. use keypoints on I(t)=0.5xI1+0.5xI2).
                    </p>

                    <p> This gives us a set of "correspondence triangles."
                        For each pair of correspondence triangles, we can compute an affine transformation matrix
                        A such that
                        [p1',p2',p3'] = A*[[p1,p2,p3],[1,1,1]], where p1,p2,p3 are the coordinates of the correspondence
                        keypoints as 2x1 column vectors. Note that on the right side of the equation,
                        "[[p1,p2,p3],[1,1,1]]" represents the homogeneous coordinates of the keypoints. Therefor A
                        is a 2x3 matrix. This can be compactly written as P' = AxP, and A can be solved as A = P' x
                        inverse(P).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rather than computing A as P'=AxP, we can also compute it as P=A'xP', which is known as the
                        inverse
                        transofrmation. For image at time t (denoted as I(t)), if we want to find the corresponding
                        coordinates of a
                        pixel/point in "correspondence triangle", we can use this inverse transfomration to obtian the
                        coordiante in the
                        source image (in our case, I1 or I2).</p>
                    <p>
                        In this implementaion, we use the "correspondence triangles", the
                        transformation matrix and
                        <code>skimage.draw.polygon</code> to obtain the correspondign pxiel coordiantes.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Weighted Average of Color (Cross-dissolving)</h4>
                    <p>The final step to complete the morphing process is cross-dissolving. At time t, using the
                        keypoints and
                        the (inverse) transofmraiton matrix, we can determine the corresponding pixel in
                        images I1 and I2 for each pixel of I(t). Now we simply perform a weighted average of the pixel
                        color, whcih should be straightforward.</p>

                    <h2 id="annotation">Annotation Tool</h2>

                    <p>To perform face morphing, we need to obtain several pairs of correspondence points from the
                        images we want to operate on. For this purpose, an annotation tool was developed. The output of
                        the annotation tool is a Python built-in dictionary, where the key is a unique ID, and the value
                        is a custom class object (Correspondence). This data structure is then saved as a
                        <code>pickle</code> file. When used for morphing, the data structure is converted into two lists
                        containing the keypoints' coordinates (e.g., [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...] or [[col1, row1], [col2,
                        row2], ...]).
                    </p>

                    <h4>"Mid-face"</h4>
                    As we mentioned in morphign methodoloy, we use the "mid-image" (or "mid-face") to genearete the
                    triangular mesh (warping weight = 0.5). Also, cross-dissolving weight = 0.5 was used to compute the
                    "mid-face" image of me and the target image (i.e.,averaging keypoitns and color).

                    <h4>"Average (Brazilian) face" and the "Brazilian Chinese" </h4>
                    I used the <a href="https://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html" target="_blank">FEI Face Database</a>
                    to compute an avearge face. The FEI face database is a Brazilian face dataset that contains two
                    categories: neutral faces and smiling faces, each has 200 images.The method involves computing a
                    'mid-face' image by cross-dissolving 200 images from each category. This process uses a template of
                    46 keypoints, as shown in the figure below.

                    <figure class="col">
                        <img src="./demo/46keypoints_ref.png" alt="" style="width:50%">
                        <figcaption>46 keypoints template the FEI database used.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <figure class="row">
                        <div class="col">
                            <img src="./demo/average-neutral-face.png" alt="" style="width:50%">
                            <figcaption>Averae neutral face</figcaption>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col">
                            <img src="./demo/average-smiling-face.png" alt="" style="width:50%">

                        </div>
                    </figure>

                    Now, I can warp my face to the 'average face' (using the neutral average face here). This involves
                    applying the triangular mesh generated by the keypoints of the average face while retaining the
                    color information from my own image (with a cross-dissolving weight of 0).

                    <figure class="row">
                        <div class="col">

                        </div>
                    </figure>

                    I can also warp the 'average face' to my face, using the keypoints from my image to generate the
                    triangular mesh.

                    <br>
                    <h4>Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean</h4>
                    What we are doing so far can be thought of as interpolation: we interpolate points between two sets
                    of points, using weights in the range of [0,1] for the weighted average. However, we can also create
                    caricatures by extrapolating the points between images, allowing the warping weight to be less than
                    0 or greater than 1.
